# Feature-engineering-ordinal-and-label-encoding
In my analysis, I used the OrdinalEncoder from sklearn for input features that had an inherent order or rank. This method assigns integer values to the categories based on their order, preserving the ordinal relationship between categories. For the output feature, I utilized the LabelEncoder, which converts categorical labels into numerical values, making them suitable for machine learning algorithms. These encoding techniques helped in appropriately transforming categorical data into numerical format, facilitating better model performance.
